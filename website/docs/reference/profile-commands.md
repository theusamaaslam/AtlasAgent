# Profile Commands Reference

This page covers all commands related to [Atlas profiles](../user-guide/profiles.md). For general CLI commands, see [CLI Commands Reference](./cli-commands.md).

## `atlas profile`

```bash
atlas profile <subcommand>
```

Top-level command for managing profiles. Running `atlas profile` without a subcommand shows help.

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `list` | List all profiles. |
| `use` | Set the active (default) profile. |
| `create` | Create a new profile. |
| `describe` | Read or set a profile's description (used by the kanban orchestrator for routing). |
| `delete` | Delete a profile. |
| `show` | Show details about a profile. |
| `alias` | Regenerate the shell alias for a profile. |
| `rename` | Rename a profile. |
| `export` | Export a profile to a tar.gz archive. |
| `import` | Import a profile from a tar.gz archive. |
| `install` | Install a profile distribution from a git URL or local directory. See [Profile Distributions](../user-guide/profile-distributions.md). |
| `update` | Re-pull a distribution-managed profile and re-apply its bundle. |
| `info` | Show distribution metadata for a profile (origin URL, commit, last update). |

## `atlas profile list`

```bash
atlas profile list
```

Lists all profiles. The currently active profile is marked with `*`.

**Example:**

```bash
$ atlas profile list
  default
* work
  dev
  personal
```

No options.

## `atlas profile use`

```bash
atlas profile use <name>
```

Sets `<name>` as the active profile. All subsequent `atlas` commands (without `-p`) will use this profile.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile name to activate. Use `default` to return to the base profile. |

**Example:**

```bash
atlas profile use work
atlas profile use default
```

## `atlas profile create`

```bash
atlas profile create <name> [options]
```

Creates a new profile.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Name for the new profile. Must be a valid directory name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores). |
| `--clone` | Copy `config.yaml`, `.env`, `SOUL.md`, and skills from the current profile. |
| `--clone-all` | Copy everything (config, memories, skills, cron, plugins) from the current profile. Excludes per-profile history: sessions, `state.db`, backups, state-snapshots, checkpoints. |
| `--clone-from <profile>` | Clone config/skills/SOUL from a specific profile instead of the current one. Implies `--clone` unless paired with `--clone-all`. |
| `--no-alias` | Skip wrapper script creation. |
| `--description "<text>"` | One- or two-sentence description of what this profile is good at. Used by the kanban orchestrator to route tasks based on role instead of profile name alone. Skip and add later via `atlas profile describe`. Persisted in `<profile_dir>/profile.yaml`. |
| `--no-skills` | Create an **empty** profile with zero bundled skills enabled. Writes a `.no-bundled-skills` marker into the profile so future `atlas update` runs won't re-seed the bundled set, and refuses to combine with `--clone`, `--clone-from`, or `--clone-all` (which would copy skills in anyway). Useful for narrow orchestrator profiles or sandbox profiles that should not inherit the full skill catalog. To toggle this on an already-created profile (including the default `~/.atlas`), use `atlas skills opt-out` / `atlas skills opt-in`. |

Creating a profile does **not** make that profile directory the default project/workspace directory for terminal commands. If you want a profile to start in a specific project, set `terminal.cwd` in that profile's `config.yaml`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Blank profile — needs full setup
atlas profile create mybot

# Clone config only from current profile
atlas profile create work --clone

# Clone everything from current profile
atlas profile create backup --clone-all

# Clone config from a specific profile
atlas profile create work2 --clone-from work

# Clone everything from a specific profile
atlas profile create work2-backup --clone-from work --clone-all
```

## `atlas profile describe`

```bash
atlas profile describe [<name>] [options]
```

Read or set a profile's description. The description is consumed by the kanban orchestrator to route tasks based on what each profile is good at, rather than guessing from the profile name alone. Persisted in `<profile_dir>/profile.yaml` so it survives reboots and is shared with the gateway.

With no flags, prints the current description (or `(no description set for '<name>')` if empty).

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to describe. Required unless `--all --auto` is used. |
| `--text "<text>"` | Set the description to this exact text (user-authored). Overwrites any existing description. |
| `--auto` | Auto-generate a 1-2 sentence description via the auxiliary LLM, based on the profile's installed skills, configured model, and name. Configure the model under `auxiliary.profile_describer` in `config.yaml`. Auto-generated descriptions are marked `description_auto: true` so the dashboard can flag them for review. |
| `--overwrite` | With `--auto`, replace user-authored descriptions too (default: skip profiles whose description was set explicitly). |
| `--all` | With `--auto`, sweep every profile missing a description. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Read the current description
atlas profile describe researcher

# Set it explicitly
atlas profile describe researcher --text "Reads source code and writes findings."

# Let the LLM generate one
atlas profile describe researcher --auto

# Fill in descriptions for every profile that doesn't have one
atlas profile describe --all --auto
```

## `atlas profile delete`

```bash
atlas profile delete <name> [options]
```

Deletes a profile and removes its shell alias.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to delete. |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt. |

**Example:**

```bash
atlas profile delete mybot
atlas profile delete mybot --yes
```

:::warning
This permanently deletes the profile's entire directory including all config, memories, sessions, and skills. Cannot delete the currently active profile.
:::

## `atlas profile show`

```bash
atlas profile show <name>
```

Displays details about a profile including its home directory, configured model, gateway status, skills count, and configuration file status.

This shows the profile's Atlas home directory, not the terminal working directory. Terminal commands start from `terminal.cwd` (or the launch directory on the local backend when `cwd: "."`).

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to inspect. |

**Example:**

```bash
$ atlas profile show work
Profile: work
Path:    ~/.atlas/profiles/work
Model:   anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 (anthropic)
Gateway: stopped
Skills:  12
.env:    exists
SOUL.md: exists
Alias:   ~/.local/bin/work
```

## `atlas profile alias`

```bash
atlas profile alias <name> [options]
```

Regenerates the shell alias script at `~/.local/bin/<name>`. Useful if the alias was accidentally deleted or if you need to update it after moving your Atlas installation.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to create/update the alias for. |
| `--remove` | Remove the wrapper script instead of creating it. |
| `--name <alias>` | Custom alias name (default: profile name). |

**Example:**

```bash
atlas profile alias work
# Creates/updates ~/.local/bin/work

atlas profile alias work --name mywork
# Creates ~/.local/bin/mywork

atlas profile alias work --remove
# Removes the wrapper script
```

## `atlas profile rename`

```bash
atlas profile rename <old-name> <new-name>
```

Renames a profile. Updates the directory and shell alias.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<old-name>` | Current profile name. |
| `<new-name>` | New profile name. |

**Example:**

```bash
atlas profile rename mybot assistant
# ~/.atlas/profiles/mybot → ~/.atlas/profiles/assistant
# ~/.local/bin/mybot → ~/.local/bin/assistant
```

## `atlas profile export`

```bash
atlas profile export <name> [options]
```

Exports a profile as a compressed tar.gz archive.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to export. |
| `-o`, `--output <path>` | Output file path (default: `<name>.tar.gz`). |

**Example:**

```bash
atlas profile export work
# Creates work.tar.gz in the current directory

atlas profile export work -o ./work-2026-03-29.tar.gz
```

## `atlas profile import`

```bash
atlas profile import <archive> [options]
```

Imports a profile from a tar.gz archive.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<archive>` | Path to the tar.gz archive to import. |
| `--name <name>` | Name for the imported profile (default: inferred from archive). |

**Example:**

```bash
atlas profile import ./work-2026-03-29.tar.gz
# Infers profile name from the archive

atlas profile import ./work-2026-03-29.tar.gz --name work-restored
```

## Distribution commands

:::tip
**New to distributions?** Start with the [Profile Distributions user guide](../user-guide/profile-distributions.md) — it covers the why, when, and how with full examples. The sections below are a dry CLI reference for when you know what you want.
:::

Distributions turn a profile into a shareable, versioned artifact published
as a **git repository**. A recipient installs the distribution with a single
command and can update it in place later without touching their local
memories, sessions, or credentials.

`auth.json` and `.env` are never part of a distribution — they stay on the
installing user's machine.

The recipient's user data (memories, sessions, auth, their own edits to
`.env`) is always preserved across the initial install and subsequent
updates.

:::info
`atlas profile export` / `import` are still the right commands for
**local backup and restore** of a profile on your own machine. Distribution
(`install` / `update` / `info`) is a separate concept: ship a profile via
git so someone else can install it.
:::

### `atlas profile install`

```bash
atlas profile install <source> [--name <name>] [--alias] [--force] [--yes]
```

Installs a profile distribution from a git URL or a local directory.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `<source>` | Git URL (`github.com/user/repo`, `https://...`, `git@...`, `ssh://`, `git://`) or a local directory containing `distribution.yaml` at its root. |
| `--name NAME` | Override the profile name from the manifest. |
| `--alias` | Also create a shell wrapper (e.g. `telemetry` → `atlas -p telemetry`). |
| `--force` | Overwrite an existing profile of the same name. User data is still preserved. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip the manifest-preview confirmation prompt. |

The installer shows the manifest, lists required env vars, and warns about
cron jobs before asking for confirmation. Required env vars go into a
`.env.EXAMPLE` file you copy to `.env` and fill in.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Install from a GitHub repo (shorthand)
atlas profile install github.com/kyle/telemetry-distribution --alias

# Install from a full HTTPS git URL
atlas profile install https://github.com/kyle/telemetry-distribution.git

# Install from SSH
atlas profile install git@github.com:kyle/telemetry-distribution.git

# Install from a local directory during development
atlas profile install ./telemetry/
```

### `atlas profile update`

```bash
atlas profile update <name> [--force-config] [--yes]
```

Re-clones the distribution from its recorded source and applies updates.
Distribution-owned files (SOUL.md, skills/, cron/, mcp.json) are
overwritten; user data (memories, sessions, auth, .env) is never touched.

`config.yaml` is preserved by default to keep your local overrides.
Pass `--force-config` to reset it to the distribution's shipped config.

### `atlas profile info`

```bash
atlas profile info <name>
```

Prints the profile's distribution manifest — name, version, required
Atlas version, author, env var requirements, the source URL/path, and
the `Installed:` timestamp recorded when the distribution was last
`install`-ed or `update`-d. Useful for checking what a shared profile
needs before installing it, and for spotting "this profile was installed
6 months ago and hasn't been updated."

`atlas profile list` also shows the distribution name and version in a
`Distribution` column, and `atlas profile show <name>` / `delete <name>`
surface the source URL so you can tell at a glance which profiles came
from a git repo vs. were created locally.

### Private distributions

A private git repository works as a distribution source with no extra
configuration — the install shells out to your normal `git` binary, so
whatever authentication your shell is already set up for (SSH key,
`git credential` helper, GitHub CLI's stored HTTPS credentials) applies
transparently.

```bash
# Uses your SSH key, the same as any other `git clone`
atlas profile install git@github.com:your-org/internal-assistant.git

# Uses your git credential helper
atlas profile install https://github.com/your-org/internal-assistant.git
```

If a clone prompts for credentials interactively in your terminal during
install, that prompt flows through. Set up your auth the way you'd
normally use `git clone` against the same repo first, then install.

### Distribution manifest (`distribution.yaml`)

Every distribution has a `distribution.yaml` at the root of its repository:

```yaml
name: telemetry
version: 0.1.0
description: "Compliance monitoring harness"
atlas_requires: ">=0.12.0"
author: "Your Name"
license: "MIT"
env_requires:
  - name: OPENAI_API_KEY
    description: "OpenAI API key"
    required: true
  - name: GRAPHITI_MCP_URL
    description: "Memory graph URL"
    required: false
    default: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse"
distribution_owned:   # optional; defaults to SOUL.md, config.yaml,
                      #   mcp.json, skills/, cron/, distribution.yaml
  - SOUL.md
  - skills/compliance/
  - cron/
```

`atlas_requires` supports `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, or a bare
version (treated as `>=`). Install fails with a clear error if the current
Atlas version doesn't satisfy the spec.

`distribution_owned` is optional. If set, only those paths are replaced on
update; anything else in the profile stays user-owned. If omitted, the
defaults above apply.

### Publishing a distribution

Authoring a distribution is just a git push:

1. In your profile directory, create `distribution.yaml` with at least `name`
   and `version`.
2. Initialize a git repo (or use an existing one) and push to GitHub /
   GitLab / any host Atlas can clone from.
3. Tell recipients to run `atlas profile install <your-repo-url>`.

Use git tags for versioned releases — recipients who clone `HEAD` get your
latest state, and you can always bump `version:` in the manifest.

## `atlas -p` / `atlas --profile`

```bash
atlas -p <name> <command> [options]
atlas --profile <name> <command> [options]
```

Global flag to run any Atlas command under a specific profile without changing the sticky default. This overrides the active profile for the duration of the command.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-p <name>`, `--profile <name>` | Profile to use for this command. |

**Examples:**

```bash
atlas -p work chat -q "Check the server status"
atlas --profile dev gateway start
atlas -p personal skills list
atlas -p work config edit
```

## `atlas completion`

```bash
atlas completion <shell>
```

Generates shell completion scripts. Includes completions for profile names and profile subcommands.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<shell>` | Shell to generate completions for: `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Install completions
atlas completion bash >> ~/.bashrc
atlas completion zsh >> ~/.zshrc
atlas completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/atlas.fish

# Reload shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

After installation, tab completion works for:
- `atlas profile <TAB>` — subcommands (list, use, create, etc.)
- `atlas profile use <TAB>` — profile names
- `atlas -p <TAB>` — profile names
